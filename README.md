# Volume Measure Density

A collection of resources, with references, for working with powders by volume.

```
volume (cubic centimeters) / weight (grains) = VMD
```

Figures and powders here are either based on provided values from Lee, or
extrapolated from other provided literature. There's no chance I've actually
transcribed these values by hand, thank lazy PDF text extraction for this.

It goes without saying, but DOUBLE CHECK YOUR LOADS.

I cannot be held responsible for any errors in the material provided by Lee, or
by myself in these files. These figures are only guide measurements to
bootstrap dialing in a volume measure. Always double check your charge volumes
and weights with other means.

I've spotted over variations of literature provided by Lee that VMD figures for
the same powder has changed. Either a correction, or error. I don't know.
